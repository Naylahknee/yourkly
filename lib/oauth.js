 * lib/oauth.js — the calls that need the OAuth App's client secret.

 * All server-side. The secret must never reach the browser bundle, which is
 * the whole reason these endpoints exist instead of the frontend talking to
 * GitHub directly.
 *
 * Imported by the Vercel functions in api/oauth/ and by server.js for local
 * development, so the two environments can't drift apart.
 *
 * Deliberately outside api/. Every file in that directory is a candidate route
 * to Vercel; this one is a module, and a module that fails to look like a
 * handler can fail the build — taking the whole deployment with it and leaving
